# UnrealDynaBlaster
Recreation of Dyna Blaster in Unreal Engine 4

*Making procedural map takes 2:30 hours but a lot of strange problems happened in ue4 so it wastes some time to fix it.
*with changing just column and row size and other variables in LevelMaker.h it is possible to make infinite levels.

*It takes 14 hours to finish the project.

**I just can't understand about "(timed power-up, around 10 seconds)" in remote control ... if there was more explain I could do it.
